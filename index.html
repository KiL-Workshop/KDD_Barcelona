      <p>This workshop seeks to expedite efforts at the intersection of Symbolic Knowledge and Statistical Knowledge inherent in LLMs. The objective is to establish quantifiable methods and acceptable metrics for addressing consistency, reliability, and safety in LLMs. Simultaneously, we seek unimodal or multimodal NeuroSymbolic solutions to mitigate LLM issues through context-aware explanations and reasoning. The workshop also focuses on critical applications of LLMs in health informatics, biomedical informatics, crisis informatics, cyber-physical systems, and legal domains. We invite submissions that present novel developments and assessments of informatics methods, including those that showcase the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing LLMs.

    <hr class="divider my-4">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="mb-4 text-muted">
        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> The paradigm of <strong>"Knowledge-Infused Learning" (KiL)</strong> looks into data, methods, and evaluations that utilize various knowledge in different forms. KiL will introduce a new vertical in KDD where researchers and practitioners will demonstrate research that utilizes knowledge graphs, guidelines, and traditional databases to complement the functionality of current state-of-the-art AI methods. Additionally, it will enable the community to create fresh assessment techniques that gauge the fairness and robustness of all similar cutting-edge algorithms.  ACM SIGKDD is one of the premier conferences on data mining and knowledge discovery, which in 2016 introduced the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation) algorithm for model explanations. Routinely, the conference has emerged as a path-breaking venue for research in Responsible AI,  providing practical solutions to challenging problems in healthcare, cybersecurity, geosciences, planning, and others. We, therefore, foresee a group of people attending the workshop who fall under the jurisdiction of ACM SIGKDD and are interested in human-centered computing, interaction and reasoning, statistical relational mining and learning, intelligent agent systems, semantic social network analysis, deep graph learning, recommendation systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> This workshop is designed for a diverse audience, including but not limited to</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Researchers and academics in machine learning, safety, consistency, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI methods and systems.</li>
          <li>Postgraduate research students and early career researchers seeking to contribute to the NeuroSymbolic AI and Knowledge-infused Learning for Large Language Models.</li>
          <li>Practitioners and professionals involved in developing, deploying, and certifying AI systems, particularly in health, cybersecurity, finance, legal, and cyber-physical systems.</li>
          <li>Regulatory authorities and policymakers who want to understand current AI challenges (especially LLMs and associated tools/technologies) and potential solutions through NeuroSymbolic AI and Knowledge-infused Learning.</li>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">We expect 20+ submissions for the workshop by encouraging four types &nbsp;of &nbsp;submissions: (i) full research papers (9 pages including references), (ii) position papers(4-6 pages) including references) (iii) short papers (6 pages including references), (iv) demo (4-6 pages) papers, and (v) industry papers (4-10 pages including references). Additionally, invited speakers may submit an invited paper that the organization will review and comment on. An experienced multidisciplinary program committee will review all forms of papers for their contributions in terms of the novelty of the work and relatedness to the workshop program. Most of the above program committee members have already been contacted and have confirmed their participation in the program committee, ensuring multiple representatives from disciplines such as information science, cognitive science, cybersecurity, healthcare, and other societal or high-stake decision-making applications.
